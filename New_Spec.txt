NEW TemplateEngine.evaluate specification

TemplateEngine should have an additional matching mode called "optimization".

When the matching mode is "optimization", the TemplateEngine should internally try the two other matching modes ("keep-unmatched" and "delete-unmatched") and use the one which replaces the most templates.

In the case that both matching modes replace the same number of templates, "keep-unmatched" should be used.
